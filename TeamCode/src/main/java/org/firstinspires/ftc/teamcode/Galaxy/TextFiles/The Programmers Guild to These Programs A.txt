----{CanOfPineapple}-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CanOfPineapple image capturing is a system that we made ourselves.
        The system has Five Simple Steps:

    1.) Create a CanOfPineapple
    2.) Get the image by calling getWhatIAmSeeing();
    3.) Create a PineappleStrainer Object passing it the picture
    4.) Call findColoredObject() passing it the needed methods
    5.) Get the pineappleChunks which can be used




----{Constants}-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most of the time, you don't need to touch Constants. But in case you do, here are some things to note.

    Constants is basically a bunch of glorified variables, as in, there are basically variables usable for other programs that look
    cool. These variables are glorified via @InfDef, a thing built into Android Studio that allows a list of vars to be contained
    into one list for when you need them.

    If you need an example for how they are used, Sensors uses '@Constants.SensorTypes int sensorType' as part of the 'addSensor'
    function. It allows for a neat autocomplete of all of the vars in the SensorTypes list.

    If you look at the @IntDef section of Constants, you should get a good idea of how they are made into a list.
    Basically, something like @IntDef({LEFT_FRONT,RIGHT_FRONT, RIGHT_BACK, LEFT_BACK}) gets vars into a list,
    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE) does... something important, and something like public @interface MotorTag{}
    allows for them to be used.

    If you ever want to use them, use import org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.Constants; to assign the list to a variable,
    and import static org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.Constants.*; allows you to use each variable individually.
